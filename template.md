# Parsing Context Errors

WrongColumn :x: means that the ParsingContext has the same startColumn and endColumn, :white_check_mark: means that they differ.

Wrongcode :x: means that the ParsingContext has an empty list of code strings, :white_check_mark: means that atleast one code string exists.

Note that these are very simple tests and the ParsingContext may still be wrong.
